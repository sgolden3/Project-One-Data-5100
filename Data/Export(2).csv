Bait/forage fish were jumping and a dead surf perch was floating on the surface. Large schools of tiny fish were seen within and adjacent to the kelp. A huge Stellar sea lion surfaced and for a few long seconds swam with his mouth open directly towards Phil. An Osprey was active during our survey and a Great Blue Heron was standing on a nearby rock intently staring into the water. We heard Northern Flickers and Belted Kingfishers.
